This is more expected based on the setup of the for loop. This is because in this example,
the for loop initializes i using let as opposed to var. One major difference is that let 
allows for block scoping, where var does not. Var declarations are typically processed before
any other code, and that is why last time the loop ran all the way through, got var equal to 3 and then
executed the delayed arrow function. This time however, since i is initialized with let, each time through 
the loop the arrow function is executed with the current i value, and stopping after i is no longer less than 3. 
The main reason is each iteration through the loop gets its own i value when using let, because it is block scoped,
while using var gets priority and therefore the loop updates var to 3 first, then executes the arrow functions. Also
important to point out that setTimeout () is the reason why question1 prints all 3's, because of the delay var
just goes ahead and updates i all the way to 3, while each iteration gets its own i value on the iteration for let i = 0 
because let is block scoped;
